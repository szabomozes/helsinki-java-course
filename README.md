# 📚 University of Helsinki - Java Programming MOOC

Hi! I'm Mózes Szabó, a second-year Computer Science student at ELTE University.

As part of my personal development and academic growth, I’m taking part in the University of Helsinki’s legendary **Object-Oriented Programming with Java** MOOC. Although it's now a legacy course, it remains one of the most comprehensive Java programming courses available online — absolutely free and open to everyone.

This repository documents my journey, including completed exercises, personal notes, and key takeaways from each section of the course.
